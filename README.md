# Python Birthday Tracker 
**This is my first desktop app project made in Python.** 

# Program: 
The program allows a user to input a person's information including first name, last name, and birthday. The tracker then saves the information, outputs it to the home page, and will create desktop notifications on someone's birthday and three days before someone's birthday.

# How to run:
- Download the Images folder under the Birthday Tracker folder.
- Download all the Python files
- Run Main.py
